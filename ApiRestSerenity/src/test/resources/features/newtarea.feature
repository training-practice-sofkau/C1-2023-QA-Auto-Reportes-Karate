  Scenario Outline: Succesfull Task Creation
    Given I have the service endpoint
    When the user send a POST request with the task data <userId>,<id>,<title>,<completed>
    Then the user sees a successful status code and the body of the response.
    Examples:
      | userId | id  | title                | completed |
      | "1"    | 201 | "Hacer oficio"       | "false"   |
      | "2"    | 201 | "Terminar taller QA" | "false"   |
      | "3"    | 201 | "Ver serie"          | "true"    |
